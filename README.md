# MasterMind
This game is called MasterMind. The game puts 4 of 5 colors in random order and you have to guess     what order the colors are in. You get a chance at guessing the correct order 10 times, before you   fail and it reveals the correct order. All the colors that are available are represented by their   first letter in capitalized form. The colors can also be repeated in the randomized selection, so   red, blue, orange, green, and white can all be in the order multiple times. An example of a         selection of the colors would look like so, " R G B W W " or " G W R R O ".
